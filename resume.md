## Background

I served my country for several years in the U. S. Army. After 10 years and 3 deployments I decided it was time for me to chase my dreams. Circa 1993 I started getting very involved and passionate with computers. particularly what I could make them do for me. I taught myself Visual Basic 3.0 and worked with Visual Basic all the way up to version 6.0 after that I moved on to PHP and currently I'm working with Python, Go, Godot and Dart/Flutter I am self taught and don't consider myself a master but I am very well rounded and quite capable of learning. I also have some experience with docker and I have experience with JavaScript and frontend development (not so much front end design). My current website which is highly lacking on design is a custom written application in Python with Flask. I setup and configured the server on a linode micro instance using NGinX, gunicorn and the Ubuntu Server distribution of linux. I have used linux for many years as a personal server and workstation at times. I would be very passionate about a career in the IT field and continue to learn and expand my knowledge. I am willing to start at a junior level so I can learn the industry as the knowledge I have is all self taught.
